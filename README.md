Land COver Project 
ðŸ§± Project Phases and Components
ðŸ”¹ Phase 1: Data Acquisition & Storage
Task	AWS Service	Description
Collect Sentinel-2 or Landsat imagery	S3	Store large raw GeoTIFFs or Cloud-Optimized GeoTIFFs (COGs).
Acquire shapefiles of study region	S3 / RDS (PostGIS)	Use vector boundaries to mask/crop raster images.
Register metadata and catalog datasets	AWS Glue Data Catalog	Enable schema discovery for easy querying and processing.

ðŸ”¹ Phase 2: Preprocessing Pipeline
Task	AWS Service	Description
Reproject, crop, normalize bands	AWS Lambda / SageMaker Processing	Use GDAL/Python (rasterio, xarray) for transformations.
Mask cloud cover and calculate NDVI	SageMaker Processing	Derive indices used in ML classification.
Join vector data with raster metrics	AWS Glue / Athena	Prepare training-ready tables from spatial data.

ðŸ”¹ Phase 3: Land Cover Classification Model
Task	AWS Service	Description
Train U-Net / CNN classifier	SageMaker Training	Use patch-based labeling (supervised or semi-supervised).
Label training images	SageMaker Ground Truth	Annotate training areas with land cover types.
Hyperparameter tuning	SageMaker Automatic Model Tuner	Optimize classification accuracy.
Store model artifacts	S3	Save model.tar.gz from training job.

ðŸ”¹ Phase 4: Change Detection & Forecasting
Task	AWS Service	Description
Compare predictions across time	SageMaker Batch Transform	Predict over multiple years of imagery.
Generate change matrix (e.g., forest â†’ urban)	AWS Lambda + Pandas/GeoPandas	Detect trends and prepare for visualization.
Forecast change using time-series models	Amazon Forecast or SageMaker RNN/LSTM	Predict land cover types 1â€“5 years into the future.

ðŸ”¹ Phase 5: Model Deployment and Visualization
Task	AWS Service	Description
Deploy model API for real-time queries	SageMaker Endpoint	Accept spatial queries and return predicted classes.
Build an interactive dashboard	Amazon QuickSight + Mapbox/MapLibre (hosted on CloudFront)	Show historical + predicted change maps.
Serve processed maps and imagery	Amazon CloudFront	CDN for static imagery or tile layers.

ðŸ”¹ Phase 6: Monitoring, Automation & Cost Control
Task	AWS Service	Description
Track data drift & model performance	SageMaker Model Monitor	Alert if model accuracy degrades with new imagery.
Automate workflows	SageMaker Pipelines + Step Functions	End-to-end ML pipeline from ingestion to inference.
Optimize costs	Use Spot Instances / Lifecycle Configs	Reduce training and inference costs.
